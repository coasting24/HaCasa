# Your first page

Now, the most exciting part begins. Creating your first page. Actually we're going to edit your first page since you had to create a page while installing HaCasa. There are 2 ways to go. 

You can create multiple views for different types like lights, security, switches or livingroom, bathroom and bedroom OR you can put everything on one page. Either way, HaCasa will work just fine so its totally up to you.

If you want to use multiple views remember that the file order of the views will determain which view comes first. So for example `01-home.yaml` will be shown first and `02-lights.yaml` second. Just give your files a logical name.

## Adding cards to the view

1. **Before you start**  
Like mentioned in the installation, you need to be able to edit your files. There are a few editors out there, like Visual Studio Code. Its up to you to configure the connection.

    **Note**: YAML is very sensitive for indentation. Make sure everything you do, has the right indentation.

2. **Open your view file**

    In the guides, we asked you to create a view file called `00-default-view.yaml`. Open that file and notice that on top, you have these default lines or something similar:

    ```yaml
    title: Home
    path: "home"
    icon: fapro:house-fill
    cards:
        - type: vertical-stack
          cards:
            - type: custom:button-card
              template: hc_header_card
              entity: weather.buienradar
            - type: custom:button-card
              template: hc_title_card
              name: "Welcome Home"
              label: "What are you up to"

    ```
From here on out, we can add some cards.

3. **Add a card**

    Adding a card is really easy. For example we are going to add a light button. You just grab this code:

    ```yaml
         - type: custom:button-card
           template: hc_light_card
           entity: <your light entity>
    ```

    and paste it underneath the last bit of code `label: "what are you up to"` already in the `00-default-view.yaml` file as shown in step 2.

4. **Refresh the page**

Now to see the change you made just go to your dashboard in Home Assistant, press the 3 dots in the right corner and press `refresh`. That it!

## Explanation

So we just added a card, and it works! Great, but how? And why? Well, HaCasa uses something called `templates` which is a part of the `custom:button-card` intergration. Practically what happends is that we already created all the cards you will see later on and the only thing you have to do, is show them on the dashboard with that piece of code you added.

Every card we create uses the `name`,`label` and `entity` values from HA itself. We use those values to fill our information we want to show by default without you thinking about it.

## Variables

Many cards are customizable by setting variables. With those variables you can set different colors or enable / disable things, like a slider. In our template list, you can see the different variables that are available for each card.
