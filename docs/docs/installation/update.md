# Update HaCasa

Updating HaCasa is a fairly simple task which we tried to make it as easy as possible. The needed steps are kinda like the same as the installation.

1. Go to [latest release](https://github.com/damianeickhoff/HaCasa/releases).
2. Download the latest `HaCasa-X.zip` file.
3. Unpack the ZIP file.
4. Copy the contents (file **and** folders) to the root of your Home Assistant configuration directory (where `configuration.yaml` is located).
5. If you use some custom cards the way we described, then those will be fine and not affected.

*You can check the file `VERSION.TXT` to see the current versions you are running.*

**Note:** If you don't copy all the files, the theme, cards and dashboard will probably not function correctly.
