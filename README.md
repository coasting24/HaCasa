## What is HaCasa?
The sole purpose of HaCasa is to provide a modern, minimalistic dashboard for Home Assistant. It is designed to be easy to use and customize, while still providing a professional look and feel. The SOAP (significant other acceptance parameters) is a key aspect of the design, ensuring that the interface is not only functional and understandable but also visually appealing to everyone in your household.
